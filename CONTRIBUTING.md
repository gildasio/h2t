## Contribute

Thank you for your interest in **h2t**. If you want to contribute to **h2t** there is a lot ways:

### Type Issues

Maybe I've typed. So, open an [issue][issue] or submit a [PR][pr].

### Features

Do you wanna a feature that isn't implemented? Open an [issue][issue] or a [PR][pr] for that.

### Add headers

Do you know any headers that would be interesting to **h2t** but isn't here? Open an [issue][issue] or a [PR][pr].

If do you want to open a [PR][pr] make sure that the database is a JSON file located at `headers` directory.

- `good.json` are headers that would be nice to be implemented
- `bad.json` are headers that isn't a good idea to maintain in production

~~~ json
"header-in-lower-case": {
    "title": "Header title",
    "description": "Description about the header",
    "refs": [
        "some_tech_links",
        "to_know_more_about_that_header",
        "it's_a_good_idea_to_link_the_specification"
    ]
}
~~~

### Code Smells

I'm not an expert pythonic so if you see something that can be better, open an [issue][issue], or submit a [PR][pr] or mailme (look me e-mail in my [website][website]).
